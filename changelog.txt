2.0.3
* Started the Gitub. Hopefully this will lead to better coordination and progress.
* Added missing english description for Pokemnon Trainer origin
* Converted stray Chinese in English Pokemon Trainer Mobilization Menu to English
* Added in missing English localizations for Pokemon farmer job description and effect description
* Added in missing English localizations for Masterball Tech
* Added in missing English localizatoins for Steel Type decision and armies.
* Vampire Missile converted small slot to bring it in-line with other weapons. Range reduced to 150. This may change in the future...
* Aura Sphere now penetrates shield and armor, acting a bit like a Point Defense Disruptor and making it effective against both missiles and strike craft. Damage has been reduced to compensate for this and it's 100% accuracy.
* Added warnings to Shattered Ring and Pokemon Trainer origin descriptions against force-spawning AIs with them. A more automatic solution ALA Giga is still pending.
* Steel Type Trainer can no longer be used with Mechanist (due to proposed AI only changes)
* AIs spawning with the Eevee Assimilator civic now have a custom personality and some custom dialog.
* Split all the Mints into three flavors: Strong (the current one), Regular, and Weak. This was due to Latias and Mew not being able to take advantage of most of them.
