2.0.3
* Started the Gitub. Hopefully this will lead to better coordination and progress.
* Added missing english description for Pokemnon Trainer origin
* Converted stray Chinese in English Pokemon Trainer Mobilization Menu to English
* Added in missing English localizations for Pokemon farmer job description and effect description
* Added in missing English localizations for Masterball Tech
* Added in missing English localizatoins for Steel Type decision and armies.
* Vampire Missile converted small slot to bring it in-line with other weapons. Range reduced to 150. This may change in the future...
* Aura Sphere now penetrates shield and armor, acting a bit like a Point Defense Disruptor and making it effective against both missiles and strike craft. Damage has been reduced to compensate for this and it's 100% accuracy.
* Added warnings to Shattered Ring and Pokemon Trainer origin descriptions against force-spawning AIs with them. A more automatic solution ALA Giga is still pending.
* Steel Type Trainer can no longer be used with Mechanist (due to proposed AI only changes)
* AIs spawning with the Eevee Assimilator civic now have a custom personality and some custom dialog.
* Split all the Mints into three flavors: Strong (the current one), Regular, and Weak. This was due to Latias and Mew not being able to take advantage of most of them.
* Pokemon Bioships: Nixed the Alloy cost in leu of increased food and minerals. This should also have the added effect of making the recall device much more valuable (that has its alloy costs increased however.) Again, this is a temp solution untill something more substantial can be done with bioships (See future plans).
* Psychic and Psyshock no longer shoot down missiles and strike craft. That's what Aura Sphere is for.
* Eeveelution assmilators can no longer assimilate fellow eeveelutions, thus preventing a forever assimilation loop. Unfortunately this means that eevees cannot quick-assimilate non-psionic eevees into regular eevees, but psionic doesn't really work ATM anyway.
* Train Steelmon/Pokemon decision now takes 90 days to enact. They need time to breed, raise, and train the mons after all. Though this is a temp solution to this issue. I hope we can eventually move this over to some sort of clone army/children of zero four system in the future and nix the decision system entirely.
