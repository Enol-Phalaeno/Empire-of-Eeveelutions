leadereevent.9.name:0 "Studying Abroad"
leadereevent.9.desc:0 "Yes, I'm an Eeveelution. At least, I was an Eeveelution...\nMy name is Hezi, biologist Elena's only daughter. Several years ago, when curator started to recruit foreign students, I passed their entrance exam, and got the chance to study further in their enclave. In these applicants I was the only Eevee that passed the exam. My parents paid high tuition to support my study abroad, and they were full of hope for my future.\nThe curator's profound knowledge deeply attracted me. In several years of apprenticeship, my grades have always been among the best, and finally graduated with the highest grade in the graduate entrance examination. However, I had to become a member of curator if I want to study further, since the research programme I participated would touch the core secrets of the curator. At that time, I thought the door of knowledge would be opened in front of me. I didn't think so much and chose to be a curator. However, after I join them, I found that what they pursue is not only knowledge...\nIn my first year as a curator, my mentor asked me to participate in a \"voluntary\" genetic modification experiment on brain enhancement. Many \"volunteers\" of different races participated in the experiment, and I was the only eevee among them. \nThe genetic modification experiment failed. Exactly, it wasn't successful. For all subjects, the genes transferred were expressed at very low levels, but there were also no side effects. The project was then shelved and returned to the theoretical stage. About how I become like this... I'll start from my supervisor's team taking over the resonant coil project."
leadereevent.9.a:0 "What is \"resonant coil\"?"
leadereevent.10.name:0 "Resonant Coil"
leadereevent.10.desc:0 "Resonant coil is a warship weapon created by our creator. According to the history, this weapon was once equipped on their gunboat called \"Tempset\". It can generate a special energy field, produce and emit neutrons concentrated by it. At that time, curators dug up the wreckage of the warship in an archaeological operation. They planned to restore the technology and sell the military technology to other countries at a high price. My supervisor took over the project.\nI grew up listening to the legend of our creator, and I was obsessed with the study of the creator's legacy. I put all my enthusiasm and hard work into this project, when everyone else was at a loss, I made breakthroughs one after another. As a result, I became the leader of the research team, other students worked for me, and my supervisor was only responsible for signing my project application - He didn't do anything else. Soon, I successfully restored the prototype of the resonant coil. But The accident happened when I tried to start the prototype for the first time..."
leadereevent.10.a:0 "What happened?"
leadereevent.11.name:0 "An Accident(1)"
leadereevent.11.desc:0 "At that time, the experiment was drawing to a close, and the entire project could be declared a success just by starting the prototype. After several hours of charging, the prototype had generated a strong enough energy field, but the low-power neutron generator used for \"ignition\" had a problem. A block of uranium used as a reflective layer was not installed in place, which makes the whole device unable to start. Only after straightening it, then could we continue our experiment. According to the operating rules, I had to stop the whole device to operate it, but I can't wait to see the light of the resonant coil.\nI violated the operation rules and went directly into the experimental field to straighten the equipment. However, during my operation, this uranium block accidentally fell off and slided into two hemispherical plutonium block near critical state. As a result, the device reached the critical point immediately, and with a blue ionization flash, the whole resonant coil was activated. I was exposed to millions of roentgens of radiation for 83 milliseconds, even though the emergency system shut down the device instantly. I was badly burned by radiation. What's more, radiation broke the phosphodiester bond in my DNA, causing the DNA in my cells to disintegrate into countless fragments. I would have dead in a few minutes if I was other eevee, but my special self-repairing gene inherited from my mother saved my life. My DNA began to recombine automatically, and the modified genes that I had been transferred were also involved in it..."

leadereevent.10000.desc:0"I started to \"evolve\" under the stimulation, and the characteristics of eight eeveelutions were displayed on my body at the same time. Besides, there is also a phenotype that has never been seen before. According to the theoretical prediction, this is exactly the trait that eevee should perform after the genetic transformation. The curators were overjoyed. They sent me to the biological laboratory and began to suppress the expression of other eight phenotype, leading me to \"evolve\" into the phenotype that have not yet seen.Finally, the genetic transformation experiment on my body was successful, the transferred gene was fully expressed, and my intelligence was greatly improved. But no one knows how it's done.Despite the curators have conducted countless studies on me, they had still not understood the technology from our creator...\nHowever, when I walked out of the biological laboratory with the sequelae of gene collapse and genetic modification, I saw my supervisor's paper on resonant coil technology. The main content of the paper was exactly the research file I wrote down myself, didn't even change a word. And my name was only on the list of research participants. No one knew I was the leader of this project, No one knew that I paid half my life for this project. No one listened to me. They didn't believe, how could a young research apprentice lead such a huge project? What they only did was to celebrate the success of the project, congratulated on my supervisor's promotion. "

leadereevent.12.desc:0 "Yes, but they don't allow me to leave. I have knew too many core secrets. During the resonant coil project, I also knew the curator's space station clearly. I was asked for staying in the curator's space station forever, so as not to hinder them from turning their patents into energy credits.But I have been completely disappointed with them, What I only wanted was to return to my motherland and my family...\nI secretly copied and cracked the supervisor's science ship activation key, found an opportunity to board the science ship alone, and then directly activated the speculative hyperlane breaching in the dock. But after the science ship left the subspace, the curator remotely interfered with the navigation system of my science ship, causing me to crash into the asteroid. I switched the science ship to the undisturbed mechanical-control mode at the last minute, but still failed to change the trajectory...The curator remotely locked all of the science ship's operating systems, leaving only the basic life support components operating, and decided to take me back. I used the electronic components of the science ship to make a simple transmitter, and send distress signals to the passing spacecraft. \nFortunately, you come...\nSorry, I have talk a little too much."

leadereevent.33.desc:0 "The Stellar Devourer is a new parasite on the galactic hunting ground, not unlike your empire in many ways. It was born out of fear and nuclear fusion. It roams the galaxy, submerging itself into stars, feasting on them from within. And it certainly does not like being disturbed."
leadereevent.33.a.reply:0 "The star-feaster is a rare breed. A new type of beast of unknown origin. The accounts we have collected are few and sparse with intel. Few sources even have firsthand experience with the thing.\n\nAll our data points to the same fact, however: it is a terror that brings nothing but ruin.\n\nThe Stellar Devourer is capable of feeding off of fusion itself. Our §Yvery§! educated guess is that its biology is the result of some outer-dimensional fusing of dark matter and solar matter. It dives into stars, feasting on their innards in order to fuel its own, internal fusion reactor. It brings death to all systems it reaches. Either they shatter like ice after its banquet, or they burn from being exposed to a second sun from within the being's belly.\n\nIt wants to feed, and it will stop at nothing to get its share. When you gaze at it, what you see is a survivor's raw fury."
leadereevent.33.b.reply:0 "The only thing we know for sure is that the collected core is the most important aspect of the Stellar Devourer. The creature desperately needs to keep its furnace burning, lest the cold void of space reaches its vital organs deeper within and makes it collapse in on itself. Without that stellar matter, it is nothing.\n\nYou can use this to your advantage. Calibrate your weapons to our specifications and you can then home in on the very membranes that hold the Devourer's digestive system together. Wound it and you will see its innards gush out across the solar system."

It's fascinating to curators, but even my supervisor knows little about it."
leadereevent.36.a.reply:0 "The Infinity Machine, as you so bluntly call it, is impervious to extraction. No information comes out from it. No hacker or engineer in the entire galaxy has been able to see through its shiny exterior to gain a glimpse of the knowledge it so obviously withholds from us. We are at a loss. We neither know what it is for, nor what it aims to do once it's done... That's what curators said, too negative I think. Maybe we can find something about it if we contact with it?"
leadereevent.36.b.reply:0 "There is perhaps one thing you could do to destroy it. We have been unable to retrieve information from it, but its hull is breakable. Miners have tried to gather resources from it at numerous times, only to come back with their ships barely holding together. But they did find something interesting: The Infinity Machine is not as rigid as it seems.\n\nIt is made of a material capable of changing its characteristics. Density, flexibility, heat, you name it! It can analyze damage in real time and change its shell to compensate, thus making itself harder to take down. Change your frequencies, adjust the thermal output of your missiles, whatever you people lumber around with, and keep changing them. That way you can get past its adaptive capabilities."

leadereevent.40.desc:0 "Ah, the scrap bot. The Scavenger is a curious construct from a lost age. It endlessly searches amongst the debris fields of the galaxy, welding guns, engines, and materials scavenged from countless derelicts onto its own hull. Its mass and firepower have been increasing in such a fashion for centuries, with no sign of relenting.\n\nIt is unknown if there is a limit to how massive it could build itself, given enough time and scrap to work with."
leadereevent.40.a:0 "Who built it, initially?"
leadereevent.40.a.reply:0 "Unfortunately, no definitive data regarding the Scavenger's origin is known to exist. Some researchers believe it to be a malfunctioning scrap collection service machine from a lost empire, its purpose long since muddled by hardware degradation. Others believe it to have originated as a single microscopic nanobot, programmed by some unknown designer to endlessly build itself larger and stronger by exploiting its environment. Still others believe it to have begun as a robotic ship's captain, the sole survivor of an intergalactic battle waged millennia ago; its reasoning systems irrevocably damaged by the sudden and ultimate destruction of its entire civilization.\n\nOf course, this is all just speculation."
leadereevent.40.b:0 "Can we communicate with it?"
leadereevent.40.b.reply:1 "There have been many attempts at communicating with, or altering the programming of the Scavenger over the years. Unfortunately, most of those expeditions ended up as part of the cosmic scrap yards where the Scavenger bot dwells. Those that were able to outrun it survived. It has welded enough heavy artillery onto its patchwork frame to single-handedly destroy an entire nation's fleet - an event that may already have occurred on more than one occasion.\n\nOf course, any such destructive encounters would only have served to further strengthen the Scavenger, providing it with more ship components to repurpose."
leadereevent.40.c:0 "$leviathans.510.b$"
leadereevent.40.c.reply:0 "As you may have surmised, the Scavenger was not built according to any definitive, pre-existing schematics.

Of course, most of these are obscured from view to the uninitiated, but curator's advanced sensors have managed to isolate them.\n\nTell your fleets to focus fire on these parts of the Scavenger's hull, and it should substantially impact the amount of damage the construct is able to take before collapsing."

leadereevent.41.a:0 "Why is the Matriarch so much larger than other Tiyanki?"
leadereevent.41.a.reply:0 "Her incredible size is an anomaly, to be sure. Curators believe the Matriarch is a wanderer from another galaxy in deep space, where a species of Tiyanki far greater in size and strength diverged evolutionarily from the Tiyanki found in our own.\n\nOf course, it is also possible the Matriarch is simply suffering from an advanced form of gigantism - though this would fail to explain her extended lifespan."
leadereevent.41.b:0 "What do you know about the captain hunting the Matriarch?"

leadereevent.45.name:0 "The Outer Gates"
leadereevent.45.desc:0 "Captivated by its design, are you not? The Outer Gates are truly a relic from an elegant, more civilized time. The Outer Gates stands as a testament to ingenuity of the ancients. Unfortunately it is also a reminder of our ancestor's greatest mistakes."
leadereevent.45.a:0 "What's the story behind them?"
leadereevent.45.a.response:0 "Know that the Outer Gates mark our forebearer's greatest crimes against the galaxy...no against the whole damn universe. Whatever claims any of the Fallen Empires said are all but lies. We have cross-referenced all of our records with each founding members, and all points to the same conclusion; our ancestors betrayed the ones who created those gates. And without them, the universe was plunged into chaos. And why did our ancestors betray them? Pure greed and selfish reasons, nothing more.\n\nWhat scares us is...the creators of the gates are most likely still alive, evidences of the past suggest they were immortal and timeless, and isolation would not stop them. The creators, were known to be considerate and merciful, unlike many other empires after them. We only hope that if they return, they will forgive our past sins. But so much time has passed. We wonder...would the creators themselves seek to destroy us and remake the universe anew?"
leadereevent.45.b:0 "What are the gates's purposes?"
leadereevent.45.b.response:0 "That we do not know fully. Based on what our surviving records could tell, these gates act as passageways between multiple galaxies, perhaps even universes. Indeed curators have very credible evidence that these gates existed beyond our galaxy, and that they could be used as effective bridges to cross between galaxies.\n\nBut that is just the tip of the iceberg. You see, it was believed that the true purpose of the Outer Gates was that they could lead to a totally new dimension, a higher plane of existence which was heavily phrased as §Y\"The Great Beyond\"§!. Curators' ancestors fought and died to learn about this truth, but none ever returned."
leadereevent.45.c:0 "What are the Gatekeepers?"
leadereevent.45.c.response:0 "The Gatekeepers were ancient precursor devices used to interface and monitor the Outer Gates. The units and their guardian fleets you encounter are but replicas of the original Ancient Gatekeeper, built by an ancient power of the past. Initially they were designed  to open the Gates that our ancestors may pass through into the Great Beyond. But the fateful event that resulted in the Great Calamity has made that impossible, now their only purpose is to ensure such mistakes never happen again."
leadereevent.45.d:0 "Who built the Outer Gates?"
leadereevent.45.d.response:0 "Probably...A very formidable and ancient empire whose knowledge and technologies far surpassed that of anything we have ever witnessed. Unfortunately, the database do not provide the gate's creators by name, only titles that each of curator ancestors came to call them. These could range from mysterious and negative toned-titles such as theEnigmas, the Anathema, or False Gods, to a more positive one such as the Elders, the Gods or even the Lightbringers. These many conflicting names and its negative meaning of the later documents, compared to the much more positive, almost revered names of the early ones suggests to us that the creators were once worshipped, but through history came to be vilified.\n\nAs for their ultimate fate, the last records about them mentioned that they have been trapped behind the other side of the gates. We do not know whether they are still out there, given that it has been over aeons ever since."
leadereevent.45.e:0 "Are the Gatekeepers hostile to Fallen Empires?"
leadereevent.45.e.response:0 "Correct. You see, the Gatekeepers were given a much earlier version of Delphic-Intelligence, one that bordered too close to True Sentient Artificial-Intelligence. They recognized their original creators as the only masters. The Fallen Empires have fallen too far into stagnation and hedonism that such criteria is no longer met by the DI's standards.\n\nThis marks as a lesson for successive DI-programming, as later versions are given additional directives to never oppose its creators regardless of conditions or changes in the society."
leadereevent.45.f:0 "How powerful are the Gatekeeper's Fleet?"
leadereevent.45.f.response:0 "Its guarding ships are not much different from the ones used by the Fallen Empires. So assuming you have comparable technologies and numbers of ships, they should pose no trouble. The tricky part is the Gatekeeper itself, for while it is not designed for combat, and its armaments are somewhat limited compared to its size, each Gatekeeper is very durable, with reinforced hard-light kinetic barriers and powerful dark energy shields. You will need to overwhelm it with superior firepower, as the ship itself is very cumbersome and lacks the ability to evade hard-hitting attacks.\n\nLast but not least, the Conduit it guards only supply the fleet's maintenance, and can't replenish lost ships. So it is also a viable tactics to gradually dwindle down their numbers first."
leadereevent.45.g:0 "Can the Gates be unsealed?"
leadereevent.45.g.response:0 "Theoretically, yes. Even should no one tamper with them, the energy field holding the seals will not hold and will eventually dissipate in time, but that is not expected to happen for many more cycles so do not count on it.\n\nShould you wish to manually break the seal, you will need to first understand how exactly does the sealing work. The seal is not meant to disable the gates themselves, rather, they create a temporal stasis field that blocks the network from functioning properly. To disable them, you will require a Keystone. The Keystone acts as interfacing device that can \"communicate\" with the seals, allowing one to manually override the command and disable them.\n\nEach Outer Gates have been locked with four seals, the first seal can be unlocked by using the Keystone itself. Second and Third seals are given secret safety protocols so we would have to do extra homeworks to get around them. No recordings of what the fourth seal required has survived, so we have to test it yourself."
leadereevent.45.h:0 "Do you oppose opening the Gates?"
leadereevent.45.h.response:0 "Actually No. The database have anticipated 26% that the creators of the gates have perished, 13% that they have travelled beyond and 61% that they are still there, waiting for someone to call them back. Why do you think this is the case, you may ask? Their records suggested that the creators of the Gates would have no difficulties disabling the seals from their sides should they wish. As such, I assume that they're quietly observing, waiting for us to re invite them back.\n\nDespite later documents painting the creators as evil overlords, and the claims made by the Fallen Empires, there are many surviving evidences that heavily implied the creators to be benevolent and just. If there's anyone who has the power to restore order to this chaotic galaxy, it would be them.\n\nSo while there are many risks, I believe the pros outweigh the cons, so no we do not oppose such ideas. After All, the gates hold so many questions, scientific or not, that should be answered."
leadereevent.45.i:0 "Is there data for Keystone farbicating?"
leadereevent.45.i.response:0 "Yes. But according to it, we need to cost large amount of resource to fabricate it."
leadereevent.45.j:0 "What are the energy seals made of?"
leadereevent.45.j.response:0 "The Outer Gates have two layers of seals. One luminates with glowing orange light, another with teal. The orange seal is based on ancient stellar power known as Stellarite. The teal one, as you may have guessed, is the enigmatic seal used by various precursor empires including Curators. Because of the shortage of Stellarite, no one has ever been able to keep it active, and it will dissipate soon. The Enigmatic Seal however will last for as long as the Enigmalith next to it keeps functioning, and even if it does not, the seal will last for approximately another twenty billion years."
leadereevent.45.k:0 "What, Stellarite?"
leadereevent.45.k.response:0 "Ah...This part of the data is a bit difficult to understand. According to my understanding...Back in the ancient times, long ago before even the Fallen One came to exist, there used to be an extremely powerful source of energy known as the Stellar Power.It's secret is to draw power from what can only be described as the souls of the stars themselves. This font of power was said to be given to the universes by an ancient god-like being, whose name has been lost to time.\n\nUnfortunately the power that once was, has dwindled. The absence of that empire and the constant war waged by the precursors have torn the realms asunder and the once glorious knowledge of the stellar have been lost...forgotten\n\nWait a minute, do you remember the strange signatures our sensors caught recently? Perhaps it is what we are finding for!"

leadereevent.46.a:0 "How long have they been around?"
leadereevent.46.a.response:0 "The exact dates of the original establishment have been lost to time, unfortunately. But there is one thing you should know, is that the current fallen empires are simply descendants of the original one. Indeed you may have asked, if the Curators were indeed part of the Fallen Empire, then why are its members composed of a different species than the current main species of the Fallen One?\n\nThroughout the ages, many have become obsessed with learning the past, and they did so by conquering over the Fallen Empires of their time. They then studied their secrets, and rewrote history itself, a version that presents them as the ancient precursor of eld. The cycles repeat over and over. We of the Curators were amongst one such cycle.\n\nTechnological advancements can bring out the worst of us sometimes, automated industry, self-sufficient economy, post-scarcity society, fleets that blacken the stars. These elements combined can turn a once ambitious empire into a stagnant, uninspired one.\n\nOur empire has a long journey ahead, you will do well to learn from these past mistakes, do not take anything for granted. Knowledge is limitless, those who believe themselves masters of knowledge, will find themselves drowned in the black seas of ignorance."
leadereevent.46.b:0 "What's the Curators opinion of them?"
leadereevent.46.b.response:0 "The current Fallen Empires? My supervisor once told that - They are nothing but spoiled kids, who took all the knowledge discovered by their predecessors and did nothing to improve or expand upon them. When they decided that we scientists, researchers and historians were no longer of use, they cut off our budgets, broke down our equipment and salvaged our labs. They took what they could and ran away, creating their own haven of knowledge and education. And after so many generations, look at what happened to the fallen empires, sitting idly in their little corner of the galaxy, acting like they are respectable elders.\n\nRegrettably, Curators are also forced to keep our activities low, the Fallen Empires only permitted curators' continued operations under the condition that they do not present ourselves as a rival. This is why curators kept only a marginal line of defenses on the stations."
leadereevent.46.c:0 "What kind of technologies do they use?"
leadereevent.46.c.response:0 "The same type as curators, enigmatic-based technology. The powers are extremely dynamic and adaptable, and can be used to further the science in various fields be it physics, engineering or society. Yet regrettably, both curators and the fallen empires have only been able to dig the surface level of it. If want to know about them, we shall take control and study any natural black holes, for yet as of now, unexplainable reason, black holes seem to contain vast amount of dark energies and dark matters."
leadereevent.46.d:0 "What exactly is this...enigmatic power?"
leadereevent.46.d.response:0 "Enigmatic Power, is the power that in the simplest term, the power to harness the void. The vast, cold and calculating space that we preside over appears to have been covered with them. However, the powers are all but invisible and unusable to most. The only place that appears to attract such amounts of energies and matters are the natural black holes scattered across the galaxies.\n\nIf want to harness this power, we must understand how to convert them into usable form, generate them as power sources then contain them in specialized devices that will keep the powers in constant, usable motion. Only then can the powers truly be utilized, only then will we begin to understand what it means to tread into the void of space."
leadereevent.46.e:0 "Why do they all seem to share the same ship designs?"
leadereevent.46.e.response:0 "Not just them, if you noticed. Curators and many other past precursors all share the same ship designs. There are some differences in the inner-workings and components, of course.\n\nThis is because all of the precursors have acquired these designs by studying the ancient ships of the long-lost civilization that was said to give birth to the stars themselves. What you see is a heavily modified, and most importantly, simplified versions of their designs. The Fallen Empires use much simpler, mass-producible versions of these ships that can be easily manufactured and printed by their shipyard auto-fabrication systems."
leadereevent.46.f:0 "How to make those precursor designs?"
leadereevent.46.f.response:0 "We need a Precursor Databank. There is one in curator's databank but it was locked. With it, we will be able to access the precursor's rich history in details, and provide us with the necessary data we need to develop our own precursor ships."

leadereevent.44.c:0 "About Stellarite Power.。"
leadereevent.47.name:0 "Stellarite Powers"
leadereevent.47.desc:0 ""Little recordings survived from the past that details anything regarding Stellarite. Even I can not provide enough information about it."
leadereevent.47.a:0 "Do Fallen Empires know about the power?"
leadereevent.47.a.response:0 "They know about its basics, yes. Any empires whose roots date back to the old times will have basic understanding of Stellarite. According to curators' archives, Stellarite was once a primary source of power in the ancient times, but fell out of use due to unknown circumstances that made them ineffective. Judging by the fact that their declines went hand in hand with the disappearance of the Omegans, most curators believed that the power simply became exhausted without the Omegans around to power them. This would coincide with the First Fallen Empire's discovery and adaptation of Enigmatic Power, which came right afterwards.\n\nEven if Stellarite becomes a viable power source again, I do not believe the current generations of Fallen Empire will adopt them, their economy are simply not built to support such powers, nor would they have the necessary specialists to maintain them."
leadereevent.47.b:0 "Many of our scientists think they are fictional..."
leadereevent.47.b.response:0 "Yes, I too would think of them whimsical stories made by childrens. Inner power beyonds Solar? Souls of the Stars? They all seem a little bit over the top, yes?\n\nBut the records and archives state this to be true otherwise. If we truly wishes to learn the power, we must believe, we must be determined. Trust in our capabilities, and the results will bear fruit. And the rest shall follow."
leadereevent.47.c:0 "Can we use Stellarite to reforge the seals of Outergate?"
leadereevent.47.c.response:0 "Unfortunately not. First off, we'll need to have full control of the gatekeepers, without them the necessary procedure to reinforce the seals cannot be done. Secondly, the amount of Stellarite required would have to be tremendous, beyond what any single galaxy could provide. Lastly, its power is too unstable, too unknown, too dangerous to be used in such a manner. It could have dire consequences."

In order to the arrangement with Phanon Corps, they have been able to make contacts with other galaxies and discovered like-minded individuals to form a larger order. Curators hope to eventually accumulate enough resources and fundings to create their own inter-galactic portal, so that they will no longer require the Phanon Corp Service, but progress has been slow. "
leadereevent.48.b:0 "How do you become a Curator?"
leadereevent.48.b.response:0 "The Curators generally accept scientists and researchers who display a certain level of aptitude in physics, society or engineerings. Usually they conduct a test and categorize a person's intellectual capabilities in tiers, starting from One to Ten. Tier One to Four are considered too inexperienced or close-minded to be inducted. Tier Five and above are what they considered to be qualified. I got Tier Eight at that time.\n\nOnce inducted into the order, we are given the rank of scribes. The scribes are tasked with studying all the records and assist their seniors in mundane tasks such as pushing objects or pressing buttons, we are also usually the one who are tasked with using HSE Suits and Crowbars to perform various hazardous tasks. \n\nAt the conclusion of their term ,they are given the rank of Professors, where they no longer need to work on mundane tasks, but are expected to travel afar and lend their expertises to empires that purchase their services.\n\nThe highest rankings of our Orders are the Archons, individuals who have contreeveested so much to the Order and thus are given the opportunity to infuse their bodies with the Archon Serum, the serum increases their thought capacity by tenfold, vastly increases their intellects and body and make them ageless. But in return, Archons are no longer able to carry offspring and permanently lose the ability to taste, feel or smell and their eyes can only see things in black and white. It is a sacrifice that only the most devoted to science are willing to undergo, and each Archon made are forever inscribed in the archives as the true paragon of knowledge unending - Like my supervisor, who was really close to the Archon Serum."

leadereevent.44.e:0 "Tell me about the Phanon Corps."
leadereevent.49.name:0 "The Phanon Corps"
leadereevent.49.desc:0 "An illusive faction to be sured. The Phanon Corps mask itself as a paramilitary force, but their real power base far exceeds what one'd expect from such a business arrangement. Even curators relied upon them for inter-galactic traversal. What do you want to know about them?"
leadereevent.49.a:0 "Who are they exactly?"
leadereevent.49.a.response:0 "Fortunately Here are some description about them in the databank. The Phanon Corps, was founded by the Legendary Smuggler, Urimurich Und Zorish. They appear to be an inter-galactic paramilitary business. The earliest known records of their operations dated back during the heating point of the Ascension War. It was said that The Legendary Smuggler secretly gathered talented individuals across the galaxies, those who suffered and became tired of the constant war that ravaged their homeland. His powerbase grew steadily, using technologies that we could not properly understand.\n\nBased on pure speculations, Urimurich's goal was simply to keep what little left of the galaxy he once knew in order, the Phanon Corps certainly has enough resources to function as a full-fledged galactic superpower, but so far they have strickly operated as a mercenary. Perhaps they simply do not desire to rule?\n\nRegardless, the Phanon Corps is a legitimate business recognized and feared by many, even the slighest mention of their names will cause many to back down any offenses. Another important thing, while the Phanon Corps never betrays its client, it also has a reputation for not always protecting the privacy of their contracts. Indeed, it is not uncommon for one empire to hire their services to hinder the progress of another empire, only for their victims to strike back at the original client when they learned of the deal."
leadereevent.49.b:0 "What's Urimurich history?"
leadereevent.49.b.response:0 "Unfortunately I know little of his pasts. Let me check the databank...The earliest known records of his activities dated back to the early stages of the Ascension War. It was said that he gathered many who have suffered through the war, and created something akin to a league of Non-aligned powers, opposing every precursor empires of the past. Using technologies that were beyond understanding of any empires, they secured their foothold, and began spreading their influences. Yet for unknown reasons, Urimurich never formally declared his faction as an empire and adopted the name of Phanon Corps; a paramilitary service for hire. His Phanon Corps then expanded across many galaxies, always holding a single system called Droppoints in each of them, never expanding.\n\nIn our opinions, beneath his somewhat his happy-go-lucky and trollish personality, lies a broken man, uncertain and unbalanced in his ultimate goals, or what he truly desires for himself. A person truly burdened by the weight of his responsibilities as a savior to many of his fans and his desires to understand himself - wait, what does this paragraph mean?"
leadereevent.49.c:0 "Where did the Legendary Smuggler title come from?"
leadereevent.49.c.response:0 "That was actually quite  hilarious, almost unbelievable tales of his exploits. It was said that once an empire asked for the Phanon Corps to steal a star from the enemy faction, and the Corps actually did. They sent a very big ship, declared very loudly that they were going to steal their star, and they did so. Another time a ruler of a nation asked if the Phanon Corps could actually smuggle death itself away from him and give it to his son, the Phanon Corps made him effectively immortal...by turning him into a space rock, drifting away into space and make his son dying repeatedly, endlessly for uncountable amount of times. I believed their names were something like Kras and Diabolo or something.\n\nMost of them are probably fictional and exaggerated of course, but the legends do not betray their reputation, for the Phanon Corps appears to have never fail in their assigned tasks, provided that the resources required to hire them were met."
leadereevent.49.d:0 "We can't seem to get Phanon Corps to do anything."
leadereevent.49.d.response:0 "While they can quickly set up their bases of operations, the Phanon Corps generally take much longer to begin their true business and services. Though they occasionally accept specific requests that appear to be fun for Urimurich himself, do not expect any services or contents for them soon.\n\nAs for how long will that last? No idea. Maybe, last for another 20,000 years, or until the Panada Singularity is actualized."
leadereevent.49.e:0 "Uhh...what's a Panada Singularity?"
leadereevent.49.e.response:0 "Arccording to the data, Panada Singularity refers to a strange and unknown phenomenon in which suddenly massive changes come to the galaxy and cause many things that were previously known to be changed or added. Empires that once had one story would suddenly appear to have entirely new, rewritten one. Technologies that were believed to not have existed, suddenly exists, and weapons that previously dealt stupidly low damage, suddenly gets buffed to deal extremely high damage.\n\nThe Panada Singularity is unpredictable, its nature causes many things that we once knew to change drastically. For instance, for a very long time, we Curators thought ourselves to know everything in the galaxy, that we were alone. That curators have only a badly equipped mundane station, and look at what they have now? Their very own starbase, and tons of things to explain.\n\nNot even the Phanon Corps is immune to its effect. Try to contact them and say the word \"Panada\", maybe it will do something. "

leadereevent.44.f:0 "About Psionics."
leadereevent.50.name:0 "Psionics"
leadereevent.50.desc:0 "The Power of the Mind...truly an intriguing subject indeed. Though we do not officially recognize their group, the Curator Order has a rogue division dedicated to the study of all things psionics, the Alarak Cult. Of course, we and our creators are also able to take control of it. So that I once met Alarak Cult and got many useful information from them. What do you wish to discuss?"
leadereevent.50.a:0 "Can someone except us develop psionics?"
leadereevent.50.a.response:0 "Most certainly yes. It appears that all organics possess the innate ability to harness psionic powers, they simply need to be made aware of it, and trigger its awakening. The process will quickly pass down from one person to another, and while initial group may be small, eventually the entire population can be made psionics.\n\nFor as of yet unknown reasons, Hive Mind entities seem to lack the ability to utilize the same type of psionics, but they seem to have the ability to \"feel\" the thoughts of a psionic empire. Abathur Host, experts in Hive Mind Study suggests that the Hives may have evolved to adapt alternate variants of psionics that focus more on telepathy and battle cohesion.\n\nAs for machines and synthetics, scientifically speaking, nothing seems to suggest they too cannot harness the power. Yet there seems to be a noticable lack of any psionic development amongst mechanical individuals, yet there are records of them suffering psionic anomalies and phenomenons as well. Perhaps they are missing a core organic component that'd allow them to otherwise understand the concept?"
leadereevent.50.b:0 "About psionics theroies?"
leadereevent.50.b.response:0 "There are multiple theories in which what could have triggered psionics, but the most well-known method is to simply make the public as a whole be aware of its existence. The process is notably harder for materialistic empires that are unwilling to admit that there is no real science behind its nature.\n\nUnfortunately, there is yet to be a way for hive minds or machines to trigger this effect, not to our knowledge at least."

leadereevent.44.g:0 "Tell us about Enigmatic Powers."

leadereevent.51.desc:0 "It's refreshing to see you taking an interest in this field of study. What do you want to know?"
leadereevent.51.a:0 "What is it really?"
leadereevent.51.a.response:0 "Although initially coined as Dark Matter, the powers that were discovered appear to deviate greatly from what most modern empires believed Dark Matter to be. The power itself could be harvested as a form of matter or energy. As such, curators decided to call them Enigmatic Power to differentiate from the old perceived definition, yet many have become so accustomed to the Dark Matter or Energy name that both were used interchangeably.\n\nAs for what it really is, based on the observation that it was discovered quite conveniently around the time when Stellar Powers started to dwindle, curators believed both powers were connected to each other. If the records provided by the Ancient Empire of Matroxis Faulst were to be believed, they would be the one who first discovered that Enigmatic Power were a result of Stellar Power \"reverting\" to its base definition. Think of Stellarite Power as puzzle pieces perfectly aligned to form an image, and then the pieces were scattered, making the box empty. Matroxis Faulst attempted to rearrange the pieces, but it began to form into a totally new image. Unfortunately, they never get to complete the puzzle, and the power was left only partially explored on the surface level."
leadereevent.51.b:0 "Can we improve upon it?"
leadereevent.51.b.response:0 "Supposedly yes. But no precursors have moved far beyond early stages of Project Alpha. If we want to pursue it, we will need a Precursor Databank.

leadereevent.52.a:0 "What were their technologies like?"
leadereevent.52.a.response:0 "Most of the precursors utilized Enigmatic Powers as their primary power sources. From planetary resource production, to space constructions, to war vessels. The connections between them were inseparable. In terms of planetary technologies, the Precursors explored field manipulation, dimensional travels, singularity containment, hard-light refraction and advanced symbiosis between organic and machine intelligences. Their space vessels were vastly different from modern ones as well, with each ship containing no more than a few people despite being several times larger than any modern military ships."

Not only that, the network also allows me to have access to their feelings. Although, after my adjustment, the psionic network will no longer interfere with my mind, but ......
