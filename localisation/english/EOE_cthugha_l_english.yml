###################思路
###由于近日点远日点距离差距过大，行星表明不适合生命生存。最早的生命诞生在温热的地层洞穴中，随着行星冷却地热资源减少，生命开始进化，获取行星表面的太阳能。当智慧生命诞生后，文明对能量的需求更大，北落师门人开始大规模开发行星表面。北落师门人的建筑以地下结构为主，有地上结构。他们的寿命和人类差不多，会在行星公转的到合适的区间内时尽可能多的收集能量（从在温度合适的地层中种植作物到之后有科技了太阳能发电之类），供子孙后代熬过漫长寒冬。在一次行星远离太阳，北落师门人开始控制人口减少资源消耗的过程中，一个崇拜光与热的宗教诞生。这个宗教的教义让北落师门人的祭祀活动可以指向克子。某次巧合下，他们的集体灵能潜势与克子建立了联系，于是他们的神明不再是虚构的宗教形象，变成了真实的个体，教义随之微调，祈祷能得到反馈，甚至能引来一丝克子的力量用于军事和能源生产。于是这个有真正神明的信仰迅速传遍整个文明，大部分北落师门人都成了克子的虔诚信徒（此时科技水平和社会发展水平大概处在人类的文艺复兴时期），开始研究自身与克子的联系。结果研究了几百年到最后真把克子招来了......

This ancient alien civilization was once deeply influenced by a powerful Shroud entity, which was locally known as \"Reshiram\" and respected as a God. The rapid development of this alien civilization in the last hundreds of years is precisely because of their research and utilization of \"Demigod Reshiram\". Finally, one day, their research on god finally reached the threshold, and devout aliens poured the power of the whole civilization to hold a ritual to summon the god. \nThe ritual was successful, but the advent of the god didn't bring them the gospel. As soon as the passage to the Shroud was opened, the blazing power of the god burned the whole planet. We don't know whether \"Demigod Reshiram\" is malicious to her followers, or she is too powerful for carbon based creatures to bear a penny...After the fire, civilization disappeared."
