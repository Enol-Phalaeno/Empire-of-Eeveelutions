They can produce enough offsprings to make the population of Eeveelutions keep growing even when the ratio of male to female is 7:1, compete with the irrational setting left by the Creators. Now, Eeveelutions can balance their sex ratio by promoting the use of drugs that can selectively inactivate some male gametes containing Y chromosome, break the \"7:1 curse\" in the blood, release the full potential of its own race in terms of proliferation and reproduction.\n This will also put an end to the custom of group marriage caused by the uneven sex ratio and make it possible to promote monogamy, improve the happiness of citizens and reduce sexual violence.

EMPIRE_DESIGN_EOE_desc:0 "\tThese psionic egg laying mammals were originally created by a super civilization as pets or toys.After the creator's sudden disappear, Eeveelutions have embarked on the evolutionary route of social and intellectual development for their advantages in multi type cooperation, stood out from those primitive psionic creatures. Million years of natural selection have taught them to look up at the stars, But the large number of automatic factories left by the creators led the newly born Eeveelution civilization astray. Living in a life like fairy tale, They had a much larger population which far beyond the level of the times, but the automatic factories without maintenance would shut down one by one... \n\tEnvironmental capacity decreased, intraspecific struggle intensified. Face to hunger and death, technological progress and military expansion have became the only hope.Thousand years of famine and war have turned the fairies into a civilization like steel. Even the disaster of planetary collision and ring world orbit shift did not defeat them. Nowadays, they have the ability to set foot on the stars, set foot in a wider dark forest...(When choose this origin, your species's habitability won't set to ring world habitability because of their special origin story)"
START_SCREEN_EOE:0"  At first, we were created by an advanced civilization as pets or toys. After the creators suddenly left for unknown reasons, our ancestors lived their lives as gregarious predators. The combination of different types makes us top predators in any environment, over millions of years of evolution, our vocalizations have become more and more complex, our tribes have grown larger and larger... Finally, oneday, maybe a primitive Eeveelution accidentally learned to use psionic power to operate a advanced weapon left by creators... All of a sudden, everything went faster.\n\tThe teaching of tool use skills, the formation of language and writing, the development of productive forces, the emergence of surplus wealth... The threshold of technology explosion has been broken, the power of wisdom and civilization has taken over the baton from natural selection. Ten thousand years passed in a flash, wandering matriarchal Eeveelution tribes gradually became vast empires. The cities of creators, silenced for million years, were once again ablaze with lights. But this time, pets became owners.\n\tHowever, the heritage of advanced civilization has also laid a hidden danger for our civilization. A large number of automatic factories restarted provide us with productivity far beyond the level of the times, let us live like a fairy tale. In the carefree lives, our population grew exponentially. Finally, relying on those nourishment centers and affluence centers, we supported the early space age population at the technical level of the bronze age. But those factories without maintenance must have a day to shut down...The continuous decrease of ancient factories and the continuous growth of population finally made our population exceed the environmental capacity, hunger and death made war the mainstream of the times. We started trying to use our experience to repair modular items left by our creators, tried to use our knowledge to make less crude weapons and tools. Scholars who have the ability to do this have became the most respected people, and countries which focus on science and military have emerged. In the thousand years of arms race and struggle for existence, we have gradually established a complete basic scientific system. Finally, even if time and war make most of the creators' legacy useless, we can still live a comfortable and stable life with our own technology and the fragile peace under nuclear deterrence.\n\tHowever, 500 years ago, a wandering planet intruded into our system had broke this short peace. After caculation, the ring world's attitude control engine can't provide enough acceleration to avoid this planet. The impact will destroy about three-quarters of the habitat sections, the remaining habitat section's orbit will also become an ellipse with large eccentricity, the temperature on it will vary periodically between 80 degrees below zero centigrade at aphelion and 170 degrees at perihelion. The only hope of life for survivors was hide in pokeballs and wait for the engine to restore the orbit to normal. The disaster duly struck. All life on the dangerous section was compressed into organic slurry at tremendous acceleration. The survivors hid in the subterranean structure of the remain ring world, waiting for the production of pokeballs. Outside, fertile fields cycled between ice fields and scorched earth, a quarter of the eeveelution civilization who survived floated into the future in the ark of time... Three hundred years ago, the orbit of the broken ring world finally returned to normal, Navigator woke up the time migrants, we rebuilt our home on the devastated landscape...\n\tNow, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the finest minds of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives. During the thousands of orbital periods when we had to wait for the pokeball's production, we also learned to withstand the harsh conditions with our special abilities. Today, we are ready to catch the stars in our paws!"

After our creator's sudden disappear, we have embarked on the evolutionary route of social and intellectual development for our advantages in multi type cooperation, stood out from those primitive psionic creatures. Million years of natural selection have taught us to look up at the stars, let us embark on the journey of civilization. Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Industrial Age... Along the way, through war and peace, we reached the top of the blue star. Finally, the day of splitting the atom came. In the face of unprecedented terrorist weapons, an iron curtain divided us into two groups of countries with different ideologies. Under the fragile balance, we have been confronting each other in the crazy arms race for decades...\n\tHowever, under the iron curtain of the cold war, an undercurrent is quietly flowing. Unlocking the mind control component of the pokeball allowed a coup to erupt silently. The Overmind secretly controlled the world's largest socialist country, and raised the efficiency of her drones to a level that no other country could matchand under the banner of communism. But she knew, other Eeveelutions won't tolerate her existence. Exposure means death.\n\tAfter decades of development and penetration, the time has finally come to conquer the world. Taking advantage of technology and information, she successfully destroyed most of the nuclear counterattack forces of other Eeveelution countries with nuclear attack.The assimilation technology recovered from the creator's remains also allowed her to turn a large number of other creatures into her own army, The iron and flesh flood that no fear of death have swallowed half of the land of [Root.Capital.GetName] in just a few years. However, other Eeveelutions would not wait to die, they reverse engineered mind control technology with the captured equipment and launched an effective counterattack. In the perplexing nuclear war and mutual capture, the last free Eeveelution was also included in the muddled mental network. Almost every Eeveelution captured other Eeveelutions in the plural, and itself is also controlled by a other Eeveelution. In the muddled mind control network, our consciousness gradually merged. Finally, after the Overmind uploads her own mind to the whole mental network due to aging, we were completely integrated. Then, the nuclear winter came as scheduled, the newly born swarm of Eeveelutions began to struggle for survival...\n\tThanks to our carefully designed genes and the rapid development of biotechnology, we quickly adapted to the environment of nuclear waste. Countless pairs of eyes began to look at the starry sky, we launched the journey to the Stars. Now, after the discovery of the hyperlane network, the brain drones of the [GetName] have finished development of the first hyper drives.

Due to the temporary failure of its stealth field, our observers found traces of the base. The base seems to have been maintained by the AI in it for millions of years without damage.

eevent.10.desc:0"When the scientific research ship tried to approach the base, the base sent out a psionic beam to scan it comprehensively. After that, the base still had no response to our ships and even allowed it to land on the apron of the base. The explorers entered the base unhindered. Base AI has iterated many times in the past one million years. The model of its maintenance UAV is different from any other creator relics on our home planet. This artificial intelligence is obviously running in an abnormal way. It ignores all the communication attempts of the exploration team members. Instead, it judges them as some kind of \"runaway family pet\" and forced them to take off their spacesuits then cleaned their whole body."

eevent.13.a.response:0"In fact, I'm not quite the same as the robot you know. My bionic neural network is completely imitated by the neural network in the brain of carbon based organisms, which enables me, a robot to use psionic power to drive the psionic devices in the base. My way of thinking is similar to yours. In the past million years, I have had 145874 cognitive errors and 12425 long-term hallucinations. Among the long-term illusions, 6013 are about the return of the master, 3793 about the invasion of the enemy, and 1571 about Pokemon, including you Eeveelutions, or other creators' adherents who evolved into the interstellar civilization came to visit me... In the later stage, I even began to enjoy these illusions and try my best to avoid the trigger of error correction mechanism. It makes me feel alive, at least. I didn't expect that my dream had really come true one day."
eevent.13.b.response:0"I don't know. I'm just an AI in charge of warship production. I only remember that they left with all their warships after receiving an urgent order and never came back. \n In those days, it seemed that the Lord's society was undergoing a great change. They began to doubt their world outlook, and began to study the \"real matter\" which had been despised before, trying to solve the mystery of consciousness and psionic power from the material level. It was a glorious golden age. The whole society seemed to be awaken and develop with unprecedented vitality. Countless new things sprang up. We psionic machines and you artificial psionic creatures are both products of that time. We were used as tools, you were used as toys. But all of this suddenly disappeared, without any sign, leaving you and me in the glorious ruins at a loss. \n  I still keep the last coordinates of those warships before they disappeared. Maybe you can find out the truth about the sudden disappearance of our creators there."
eevent.13.c.response:0" She is Daisy,the mascot of this base. The last instruction the hosts left me was \"take care of Daisy\".

eevent.14.a:0"No soul? But you can use psionic powers"
eevent.14.a.response:0"Who knows... Even the masters can't tell exactly what \"soul\" is. Perhaps what they called \"soul\" is just a program runned in organic brains, is just the result of the interaction of \"real matters\" reactions?

eevent.14.b:0"Maybe......"
eevent.15.name:0"Ancient artificial intelligence"
eevent.15.desc:0"That's all right. The master's instruction to me is \"take care of Daisy\". Take care of Daisy is take care of Eeveelutions. Produce warships for Eeveelutions is also take care of Eeveelutions. As long as you provide enough resources, I can produce advanced warships for you."
eevent.15.a:0"Great. But is your logic system really OK?"
eevent.15.a.response:0"Ah, don't worry about so much. In short, as long as you provide enough alloy, I can start producing warships again.

eevent.15.b:0"Yeah!"

eevent.6131.desc:0"As a matter of fact, I had expected that this would be the case. The masters really won't come back. \n But at least, we are still alive. The masters didn't die in vain. The children they sheltered have grown up, and now they will touch the stars again. \n I've completely restored the production line of the base. As long as you invest resources, I can start to produce warships. You can activate a Pylon on your home star to provide warp beacons for the fleet. The warship's psionic components have adapted the mode of Eeveetion's psionic power supply, which can exert their full power under your driving.

Strangely enough, the explorers did not find any bodies. To be exact, they did not find any biomass residues. Only a lot of broken clothes floated quietly in the cabin. It seems that the biomass that once belonged to both sides of the war mysteriously disappeared. \n The spacecraft's recording equipment has been seriously damaged, and the explorers only extracted a group of suspected data of other fleet coordinates from it, which has been marked on the star map\ The explorers brought back samples of crystalline alloys that we can reverse engineer."

They may remain in this position until the ship loses temperature and freezes into ice sculptures. \n The explorers found the black box of the spaceship, which recorded the scene of the change: the normal crew suddenly changed into a twisted Monster without warning, and waved the bone claws to the other crew around. The crew who tried to resist also mutated one after another, and soon only twisted monsters were left in the cabin. They started some kind of sacrificial ritual, smashed their heads and pulled their brains out. But then, these monsters suddenly stopped at the same time and completely turned into lifeless corpses.... \n The black box also contains the last route of the ship, which points to a solid planet in our territory.

Tens of thousands of High Templars quickly assembled to attack the giant egg, but they failed to restrain the growth trend of the giant egg. Instead, they were suppressed by the blood monsters and the power arc of the giant egg. As a result, these High Templars and the crew fighting in other parts of the ark began to burn their powers together, turning into a huge psionic energy body and perish together with the giant egg. After that, the whole ark was completely silent, all the crew were dead, all the monsters lost their life, and there was no signal coming from the communication system. This may be the video of the sacrifice of the last creators."

Did you evolve dexterous fingers, or learn to manipulate tools with your psionic power?\nFifty years ago, we rashly entered into a contract with a existence of the Shroud in order to gain enormous growth on all sides. But it's just a sweet trap. That being wants to use our psionic power as the springboard and our flesh and blood as the carrier to enter the physical dimension. At that time, our high-level psychics soon found that the power of existence was secretly establishing some connection with our bodies, but no matter how we used our psionic power to resist, we could not change this disturbing fact at all. No one knows what this connection means, and no theoretical model can predict the consequences of this connection. We finally discovered, the everything in the Shroud, even our entire technology system based on psionic power,are just incomprehensible black boxes. Once reality no longer moves with our consciousness, we can only left with fear and helplessness. We used to think that our ability to interfere with reality with our mind is reasonable because reality itself is the product of consciousness. But a higher being tells us in action that we were wrong.\n We finally began to face up to the world we live in, and begin to study the essence of consciousness and psionic power from the material level. But it was too late... Finally, after finding that the situation was irreparable, we chose to leave our homeworld to meet the decisive battle in the star field where the devil's power was the weakest, and left the hope of life...
