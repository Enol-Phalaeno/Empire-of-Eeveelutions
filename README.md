图标炸了：district_rw_hive_EOE，Job EOE_assimilation

本地化缺失：building_hive_cluster_EOE_desc，d_EOE_ghost_portal，d_EOE_ghost_portal_desc

未知错误：Error: "Unexpected token: from, near line: 252" in file: "common/diplo_phrases/EOE_diplo_phrases.txt" near line: 257

EOEbuliding.25，宝可梦理想城的文案还没写好，鸽了


errorlog里未知报错有点太多了，不止写的这一点，但是不想理了

现在使用特质控制事件的话能不能把以前使用政体控制事件的遗留部分删掉

月： 打算给梦幻加隐身，给创造者事件链的结局事件写个新星系，把一些同人文塞到核子的面板里。检查图标的时候发现环开蜂巢的图标没问题但是功能有问题

TODO (in english):

The icon is fried: district_rw_hive_EOE, Job EOE_assimilation

Localization missing: building_hive_cluster_EOE_desc, d_EOE_ghost_portal, d_EOE_ghost_portal_desc

Unknown error: Error: "Unexpected token: from, near line: 252" in file: "common/diplo_phrases/EOE_diplo_phrases.txt" near line: 257

EOEbuliding.25, the copywriting of Pokémon Dream City has not been written yet, it’s a pigeon

There are too many unknown errors reported in the errorlog, not just this, but I don’t want to deal with it

If you use traits to control events now, can you delete the remaining parts that used to control events with government?

Month: I plan to add invisibility to the dream, write a new galaxy for the ending event of the creator event chain, and stuff some fanfiction into the nuclear panel. When I checked the icon, I found that the icon of ringing the honeycomb was fine, but there was a problem with the function.
