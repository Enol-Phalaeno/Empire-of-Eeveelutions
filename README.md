TODO List:

Immediate: 

* Ditch the mint system for a more sane, vanilla-based computer system.
 * Possibly replace the mint system with something akin to the 'held item' system in pokemon (thus also removing the leftovers and making that one of the held items)
* Find/make a way to allow for Megaevolution perks to be applied if you take the Psionic or Cybernetic routes. Currently there's only the way to do so 
* Rebalance remaining non-legendary pokemon weapons for 3.6
* Fix any remaining Localization issues.
* Fix breed/assemble abuse by adding the condition that it can only be activated if availble jobs and unemployment are both above zero.
* New pokemon weapon type: Unkown Strike Fighter.
* Remove stacking 5% on pokemon worlds and replace that with a built-in ruler job.
* Remove Duelists from pokemon Trainer/Arcology Leisure districts as they're pointless, and replace those with a single ruler job that adds +1% resource production for every 100 amenities.
* Pokemon Trainer Job: Reduce Planetary Defense Armies per pop from 2 to 1. Or just adds a straight powerful defense army instead of the PDA PP. We already have the 'Plants vs. Aliens' goveneor trait for this after all.
* Remove the Planetary Decision system from Steel Type/Pokemon Trainer and replace it with some sort of Clone Army/Children of Zero Four like system (but it assembles the Steel Type/Othermons instead of your main species).

Future:

* Begin Eeveelution Keepers
* Refine Eeveelution Trainers further
  * Find non-legendary pokeship models
  * Make current pokeships legendary (event-based) only. 
* Lucario Rival Mid-Game Crisis for Pokemon Trainer Origin (Pokemon Trainer origin meets the Great Khan)
