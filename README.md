TODO List:

Immediate: 

* Rebalance remaining non-legendary pokemon weapons for 3.6
* Fix any remaining Localization issues.
* Fix breed/assemble abuse by adding the condition that it can only be activated if availble jobs and unemployment are both above zero.
* Remove stacking 5% on pokemon worlds and replace that with a built-in ruler job.
* Remove Duelists from pokemon Trainer/Arcology Leisure districts as they're pointless, and replace those with a single ruler job that adds +1% resource production for every 100 amenities.
* Pokemon Trainer Job: Reduce Planetary Defense Armies per pop from 2 to 1. Or just adds a straight powerful defense army instead of the PDA PP. We already have the 'Plants vs. Aliens' goveneor trait for this after all.
* Steel Type Trainer: Make it AI friendly so they get a straight bonus to robot production plus a free roboticist job. Also give them a "Steel Type Assimilator" hidden perk that converts normal robots into Steel Type Mons just to be safe.

Future:

* Begin Eeveelution Keepers
* Refine Eeveelution Trainers further
  * Find non-legendary pokeship models
  * Make current pokeships legendary (event-based) only. 
* Lucario Rival Mid-Game Crisis for Pokemon Trainer Origin (Pokemon Trainer origin meets the Great Khan)
